# I am just sharing my experience on hosting my personal static website using reactjs and markdown files in github

## background 
I decided to create a static readonly website for me to expose my achievements and a blogging functionality to provide my experience on the issues faced in day to day technical work.

So i bought a domain in my name but looking for free hosting but didn't find one, for my usage and need affording to that is not worth. I came across hosting a website in the staic Github. 

Github already provided a jekyll to host a blog 

Read few documents and got an idea of hosting it via angular or React , but i have a question on google indexing . and finally found that Google indexes the JS website
example if you search preactjs in google it will provide the result https://preactjs.com/ this is purly written in JS. 

So i got what i want. then the action starts to create a personal site with blogging functionaliy that can be hosted in the GITHUB using reactjs and github APIs. Let me explain what i did .
	
## setting up the website

<script>
	alert("Hello Alert");
</script>
